# 7 amazing budget friendly North Indian Places to eat in Bangalore


Having lived in Bangalore for over three years now, I've heard a lot of people
say that there just aren't enough good, pocket friendly North Indian places to
eat in Bangalore. I've experienced the contrary both because of where I live
and my constant badgering of people for their recommendations. While I'm
Madrasi (anywhere south of Mumbai, of course) and my culinary tasting
abilities of the north are indeed questionable, I've heard nothing but good
reviews of these places from others who frequent them as well.

Here are the top 7 according to me. I've constrained myself here to a budget
of Rs. 300 for two. Also do note that all theses places except the last two
are not great in terms of ambience and are probably not places you would take
a date to:

1. [Delhi Food Point](http://www.zomato.com/bangalore/delhi-food-point-koramangala): 
Located on stretch between Wipro Park, Koramangala and
Jakkasandra, Delhi Food Point has some amazing food at very pocket friendly
prices. I have been eating here for more than a year and a half now - the
half-currys are a blessing for those who eat alone. Must tries here are the
Tomato Fry, Daal Methi, and Bhindi Fry. A meal for two will probably cost you
around Rs. 250.

1. Ghar Ka Khana: You'll have to look really hard to spot this place (they
don't even have a Zomato listing) - it's located on the first floor of a
building near the well known Cafe Thulp[^1]. The veg thali and the "buffet"
here are very good; the Daal Bhaati on Sundays is a must try. Their packaging
for deliveries is extremely well done though they do take their time. I'm told
they do have another branch or two in Bangalore. A meal for two will cost you 
around Rs. 200.

1. [Shree Shyam Rajasthani Thali](http://www.zomato.com/bangalore/shree-shyam-thali-koramangala): I found
out about this place less than 3 months ago[^2] and have been a regular ever
since. Located opposite Sree Krishna Kafe, their parathas and daal bhaatis are
must haves. A meal for two here will probably set you back under Rs. 250.

1. [Sethji Ki Rasoi](http://www.zomato.com/bangalore/sethji-home-made-food-indiranagar): My 
go-to place in Indiranagar (located on the road opposite Diamond District)
when I'm craving for some pocket friendly North Indian food. Their chole and
bhindi curries are very good (if a bit spicy, sometimes). A meal for two here
should come to under Rs. 300.

1. [Paratha Plaza](http://www.zomato.com/bangalore/paratha-plaza-koramangala):
Situated just behind Oasis Mall, Koramangala, this just made my list ahead of
the competing Tattva Cafe. The sattu-based "Healthy Bihar" Paratha here is a
must try.  A meal for two here will probably total to well under Rs. 200. I
believe they also have branches in HSR, JP Nagar, and BTM.

1. [Gud Dhaani](http://www.zomato.com/bangalore/gud-dhani-btm): Located in BTM
Layout, just beside the Lake Road, this place has both an extremely religious
following and much better ambience than the places listed above. The "Hara
Bhara Karela" here is absolutely mind blowing. It gets very crowded on Friday
nights and weekends - expect a minimum 20 minute waiting time. A meal for two
here will probably come to just over Rs. 300.

1. [Om Pure Veg](http://www.zomato.com/bangalore/om-pure-veg-koramangala):
Although this place does stretch the above stated budget constraint, I simply
cannot leave it out. While I have been a regular here for over two years now,
the first time I ate here was only because I had been refused a table (an hour's
waiting) at the neighbouring [Gramin](http://www.zomato.com/bangalore/gramin-koramangala)! 
The thali here is definitely the centre piece; their Saboodana Kichdi is
extremely appetizing as well. Add a very well done minimialist-themed
ambience, some very good instrumental music, and a tagline that says "when you
are tired of eating out", it should be easy to understand why this place is a
favourite of mine. A meal for two here will probably cost you just over Rs.
350.

**Bonus**: Poha at the Bikaner Sweets Centre (behind Wipro Park) for breakfast is
some of the best I have ever had. It's standing only and Poha finishes by 11am
on most days.  It's popularity has tremendously increased over the last three
years; be prepared to wait 15 minutes to get a plate to eat on weekend
mornings:
