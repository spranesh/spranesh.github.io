# Fairfax Financial Holdings


Fairfax financial holdings was formed when Prem Watsa and a motley crew of four
others took over Markel Financial Canda in 1985. Since then, Fairfax has
compounded it's book at nearly 20% per year. A $10,000 investment in 1985 would
be worth nearly $2 million today.

Many consider Fairfax to be the Berkshire Hathaway of Canada. However, the last
few years have not been easy for the company due to increased caution exercised
by the management. After some changes to the investment portfolio last year,
and unlocking hidden value in the last two quarters, the future looks
promising.
