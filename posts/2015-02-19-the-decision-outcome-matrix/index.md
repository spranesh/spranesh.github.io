# The decision-outcome matrix


Consider any decision that can either be _taken_ or _not taken_[^1] and the outcome of this decision
to either be _good_ or _bad_[^2].

[^1]: In the real world, decisions can also be partially taken.
[^2]: Of course, there will be a lot of subjectivity in such a labelling. What classifies and _good_ as opposed to _bad_ is a function of mental outlook, risk profile, and optimism.

**1** and **4** are the easy cases - much good was had, and much sadness was avoided.

**2** leads to a feeling of disappointment, with much time spent on focusing on
the outcome. **3** leads to regret, with much time spent on focusing on the
personal choices and a desire to have done something differently. These two
feelings are not the same[^3] and while the relative magnitude of these feelings
is of course a function of personal outlook, studies[^4] do show that dealing
with regret is harder[^5].

When faced with  hard decisions, boiling them down to dealing with
disappointment (if things do not work out) versus dealing with regret (if things worked out and
one had not chosen) has always given me more clarity.

[^3]: [Zeelenberg(1998)](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/026999398379727?journalCode=pcem20#.VOWWDc7vZhE) discusses how regret leads to different future behaviour from disappointment.

[^4]: More recently, in 2009, a study by [Hannah Faye, Richard Gonzalez et al](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gonzo/papers/chua-etal-2009-regret.PDF) showed how regret led to a greater magnitude of negative feelings and a higher probability to change a previous decision.

[^5]: There is also a geographical element to this. In [The Art of Choosing](http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Choosing-Sheena-Iyengar/dp/0446504114), Sheena Iyengar describes how some cultures find it easier to reconcile with choices than others. Particularly autonomous cultures place the emphasis on an incorrect choice on the individual while more subservient cultures tend to be more forgiving of wrong decisions.
