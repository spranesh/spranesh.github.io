# Amerco Holdings (U-Haul)


Founded in 1945, U-Haul and it's white and orange trucks have become synonymous
with do-it-yourself moving in North America. The company recently crossed
20,000 company operated stores and franchised stores across North America,
leading to a growing moat in the one-way moving segment. Along with it's
growing moving segment, the company has increased it's EPS at a CAGR of 17%
over the last 10 years!
