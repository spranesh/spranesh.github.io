<p>My notes from this podcast:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Every bear market is unique. By definition, every time there&rsquo;s a bear
market, it feels different. If it turns out to be the end of civilization,
we will have more things to worry about than our investments. If you didn&rsquo;t
have uncertainty or a scary thing you would not have a bear market. It&rsquo;s the
definition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Corona virus won&rsquo;t be as bad as the black plague. We understand a lot more
about hygeine and germ theory than they did in 1300s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine you own a hotel by the beach and there&rsquo;s a giant hurricane coming.
You will perhaps temporarily close the hotel, maybe you are forced to lay
off some employees, but you&rsquo;re not going to sell it just because the outlook
over the next few months is negative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are compensated with higher returns in stocks exactly because of times
like this. If the stock market was always smooth sailing, then we shouldn&rsquo;t
get paid much more than safe investments like bonds should give us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Going back to the hotel example, If you want to own a business like that you
need to be prepared to withstand the occasional hurricane. If you&rsquo;re not
prepared, you will suffer. The time to prepare is not in the middle of the
hurricane but it is when there is calm on the horizon. If you&rsquo;re going to
invest in stocks, you need to understand that bear markets are part of the
landscape. You shouldn&rsquo;t be any more surprised by them then you should be by
blizzards in northern New England.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the comments JL Collins is getting on his blog, he estimates that
about 2/3 of his commenters have understood this need to prepare. They are
sleeping well. The remaining 1/3 of his readers are panicking and he feels
that they did not understand themselves and their risk tolerances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1987, on Black Monday, the market fell over 23%. It still remains the
biggest in history. While Collins was invested, he didn&rsquo;t realize it fell
until a casual evening conversation with his broker that he initiated
purely by chance. The flow of news from then to today is just worlds apart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After that market drop in 1987, the market continue to grind down slowly
over time. Despite knowing that he should stay the course, JL Collins
couldn&rsquo;t control his nerve and got out close to the bottom.  The market then
began its relentless right up and he kept watching, it kept expecting things
to fall and of course that never happened. He finally got back in much later
at higher price. That lesson is what sustained Jim Collins in 2007-2008.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The host of the podcast, Brandon, had some excess cash in 2007 due to sale
of his house. He kept buying but the market kept tanking and he would buy
less and less each time. He could never fully deploy his cash. As a result,
he now really believes in the power of systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are in the wealth accumulation phase, and are spending less than you
earn, a bear market like this is a huge gift. Such people should keep
investing as aggressively as they can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are in the wealth preservation stage, that&rsquo;s the time to introduce
bonds in the portfolio &ndash; in order to smooth the ride at times like this by
rebalancing annually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ideally you would have done self reflection during calm and figured out how
much in stocks works for you. But if you haven&rsquo;t this is a good time to
learn about your behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bear markets almost always happen rapidly. There&rsquo;s a saying on Wall
Street, &ldquo;stocks take the stairs up and take the elevator down&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot predict the bottom. The last two days of last week (2020 March
9-13) are a perfect example of that. The market had its worst day since
1987 followed by one of its best days right after.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone who thinks they know what&rsquo;s going to happen to stock prices in short
term doesn&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Going back to the hotel on the beach analogy, there is always a concern
about how long an event will last and whether there will be sufficient cash
for the hotel. That&rsquo;s precisely the reason one needs to be diversified
across sectors and companies by owning broad-based index funds. Some
companies will fold while others emerge stronger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bear markets are a necessity for a healthy economy - it provides a way for
weak companies to fold, and strong companies to emerge stronger. It
separates the wheat from the chaff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jim Collins talks about his blog post called the <a href="https://jlcollinsnh.com/2017/07/26/time-machine-and-the-future-returns-for-stocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">time
machine</a></p>
<p>The market returned 12% on average over the 40 years from 1975 till 2017
(time of the post). However, that time period only seems like a golden
period to invest in hindsight. In realtime, it was filled with uncertainty,
wars, inflation, black Monday, etc. That return was in spite of that
uncertainty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The time to figure out your plan is when things are calm, not right now.
For anyone concerned or worried right now, don&rsquo;t do anything. Do nothing
until this storm passes and then figure out what your plan is.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Bear markets are the best time to learn about oneself and one&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
