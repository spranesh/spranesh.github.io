# If you could only read 2 pages on investing


Over the last few years, I've spent significant time reading Buffet's annual
letters, Security Analysis (Graham & Dodd), and listening to people like Tom
Geyner (of Markel Capital) talk about their steadfast principles. I was
recently asked by a friend if I could pick a 2 page summary.  Without sparing
it much thought, I answered in the negative. How could anything less than 3[^1]
books expound the mere basics of what makes an asset?

[^1]: The count of 3 excludes the elementary reading that would explain terminology, of course.

Last weekend, I was reading through [Berkshire's 2013 letter to
shareholders](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2013ltr.pdf) for the
third time in the last two years, when I found a 2-page gem. In that short
piece, Buffet had managed to talk about valuation, return on equity,
anticipated (future) earnings, estimated growth, Mr. Market, the difference
between price-and-value, and the positives of being passive and aloof. More so,
without using any terminology or jargon that my friend would not understand!

If you could only read 2 pages on investing, this would be it:

> Some Thoughts About Investing
> 
> "Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike." -- The
> Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham
> 
> It is fitting to have a Ben Graham quote open this discussion because I owe
> so much of what I know about investing to him. I will talk more about Ben a
> bit later, and I will even sooner talk about common stocks. But let me first
> tell you about two small non-stock investments that I made long ago. Though
> neither changed my net worth by much, they are instructive.
> 
> This tale begins in Nebraska. From 1973 to 1981, the Midwest experienced an
> explosion in farm prices, caused by a widespread belief that runaway
> inflation was coming and fueled by the lending policies of small rural banks.
> Then the bubble burst, bringing price declines of 50% or more that devastated
> both leveraged farmers and their lenders. Five times as many Iowa and
> Nebraska banks failed in that bubble's aftermath than in our recent Great
> Recession.
> 
> In 1986, I purchased a 400-acre farm, located 50 miles north of Omaha, from
> the FDIC. It cost me $280,000, considerably less than what a failed bank had
> lent against the farm a few years earlier. I knew nothing about operating a
> farm. But I have a son who loves farming and I learned from him both how many
> bushels of corn and soybeans the farm would produce and what the operating
> expenses would be. From these estimates, I calculated the normalized return
> from the farm to then be about 10%. I also thought it was likely that
> productivity would improve over time and that crop prices would move higher
> as well. Both expectations proved out.  I needed no unusual knowledge or
> intelligence to conclude that the investment had no downside and potentially
> had substantial upside. There would, of course, be the occasional bad crop
> and prices would sometimes disappoint. But so what? There would be some
> unusually good years as well, and I would never be under any pressure to sell
> the property. Now, 28 years later, the farm has tripled its earnings and is
> worth five times or more what I paid. I still know nothing about farming and
> recently made just my second visit to the farm.
> 
> In 1993, I made another small investment. Larry Silverstein, Salomon's
> landlord when I was the company's CEO, told me about a New York retail
> property adjacent to NYU that the Resolution Trust Corp. was selling. Again,
> a bubble had popped -- this one involving commercial real estate -- and the
> RTC had been created to dispose of the assets of failed savings institutions
> whose optimistic lending practices had fueled the folly.  Here, too, the
> analysis was simple. As had been the case with the farm, the unleveraged
> current yield from the property was about 10%. But the property had been
> undermanaged by the RTC, and its income would increase when several vacant
> stores were leased. Even more important, the largest tenant's who occupied
> around 20% of the project's space -- was paying rent of about $5 per foot,
> whereas other tenants averaged $70. The expiration of this bargain lease in
> nine years was certain to provide a major boost to earnings. The property's
> location was also superb: NYU wasn't going anywhere.
> 
> I joined a small group, including Larry and my friend Fred Rose, that
> purchased the parcel. Fred was an experienced, high-grade real estate
> investor who, with his family, would manage the property. And manage it they
> did. As old leases expired, earnings tripled. Annual distributions now exceed
> 35% of our original equity investment. Moreover, our original mortgage was
> refinanced in 1996 and again in 1999, moves that allowed several special
> distributions totaling more than 150% of what we had invested. I've yet to
> view the property.  Income from both the farm and the NYU real estate will
> probably increase in the decades to come. Though the gains won't be dramatic,
> the two investments will be solid and satisfactory holdings for my lifetime
> and, subsequently, for my children and grandchildren.
> 
> I tell these tales to illustrate certain fundamentals of investing:
> 
> * You don't need to be an expert in order to achieve satisfactory investment
> returns. But if you aren't, you must recognize your limitations and follow a
> course certain to work reasonably well. Keep things simple and don't swing
> for the fences. When promised quick profits, respond with a quick "no".
> 
> * Focus on the future productivity of the asset you are considering. If you
> don't feel comfortable making a rough estimate of the asset's future
> earnings, just forget it and move on. No one has the ability to evaluate
> every investment possibility. But omniscience isn't necessary; you only need
> to understand the actions you undertake.
> 
> * If you instead focus on the prospective price change of a contemplated
> purchase, you are speculating.  There is nothing improper about that. I know,
> however, that I am unable to speculate successfully, and I am skeptical of
> those who claim sustained success at doing so. Half of all coin-flippers will
> win their first toss; none of those winners has an expectation of profit if
> he continues to play the game. And the fact that a given asset has
> appreciated in the recent past is never a reason to buy it.
> 
> * With my two small investments, I thought only of what the properties would
> produce and cared not at all about their daily valuations. Games are won by
> players who focus on the playing field -- not by those whose eyes are glued
> to the scoreboard. If you can enjoy Saturdays and Sundays without looking at
> stock prices, give it a try on weekdays.
> 
> * Forming macro opinions or listening to the macro or market predictions of
> others is a waste of time.  Indeed, it is dangerous because it may blur your
> vision of the facts that are truly important. (When I hear TV commentators
> glibly opine on what the market will do next, I am reminded of Mickey
> Mantle's scathing comment: "You don't know how easy this game is until you
> get into that broadcasting booth.")
> 
> * My two purchases were made in 1986 and 1993. What the economy, interest
> rates, or the stock market might do in the years immediately following --
> 1987 and 1994 -- was of no importance to me in making those investments. I
> can't remember what the headlines or pundits were saying at the time.
> Whatever the chatter, corn would keep growing in Nebraska and students would
> flock to NYU.
>
> There is one major difference between my two small investments and an
> investment in stocks. Stocks provide you minute-to-minute valuations for your
> holdings whereas I have yet to see a quotation for either my farm or the New
> York real estate.
> 
> It should be an enormous advantage for investors in stocks to have those
> wildly fluctuating valuations placed on their holdings --  and for some
> investors, it is. After all, if a moody fellow with a farm bordering my
> property yelled out a price every day to me at which he would either buy my
> farm or sell me his -- and those prices varied widely over short periods of
> time depending on his mental state -- how in the world could I be other than
> benefited by his erratic behavior? If his daily shout-out was ridiculously
> low, and I had some spare cash, I would buy his farm. If the number he yelled
> was absurdly high, I could either sell to him or just go on farming.  Owners
> of stocks, however, too often let the capricious and often irrational
> behavior of their fellow owners cause them to behave irrationally as well.
> Because there is so much chatter about markets, the economy, interest rates,
> price behavior of stocks, etc., some investors believe it is important to
> listen to pundits -- and, worse yet, important to consider acting upon their
> comments.
> 
> Those people who can sit quietly for decades when they own a farm or
> apartment house too often become frenetic when they are exposed to a stream
> of stock quotations and accompanying commentators delivering an implied
> message of "Don't just sit there, do something." For these investors,
> liquidity is transformed from the unqualified benefit it should be to a
> curse. 
> 
> A "flash crash" or some other extreme market fluctuation can't hurt an
> investor any more than an erratic and mouthy neighbor can hurt my farm
> investment. Indeed, tumbling markets can be helpful to the true investor if
> he has cash available when prices get far out of line with values. A climate
> of fear is your friend when investing; a euphoric world is your enemy.
> 
> During the extraordinary financial panic that occurred late in 2008, I never
> gave a thought to selling my farm or New York real estate, even though a
> severe recession was clearly brewing. And, if I had owned 100% of a solid
> business with good long-term prospects, it would have been foolish for me to
> even consider dumping it. So why would I have sold my stocks that were small
> participations in wonderful businesses? True, any one of them might
