<p>Last weekend, I was reading through <a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2013ltr.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Berkshire&rsquo;s 2013 letter to
shareholders</a> for the
third time in the last two years, when I found a 2-page gem. In that short
piece, Buffet had managed to talk about valuation, return on equity,
anticipated (future) earnings, estimated growth, Mr. Market, the difference
between price-and-value, and the positives of being passive and aloof. More so,
without using any terminology or jargon that my friend would not understand!</p>
<p>If you could only read 2 pages on investing, this would be it:</p>
<p>(<em>Reproduced from pages 17-19 of the <a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2013ltr.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Berkshire Hathaway 2013 Annual Chairman&rsquo;s
Letter</a></em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some Thoughts About Investing</p>
<p>&ldquo;Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike.&rdquo; &ndash; The
Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham</p>
<p>It is fitting to have a Ben Graham quote open this discussion because I owe
so much of what I know about investing to him. I will talk more about Ben a
bit later, and I will even sooner talk about common stocks. But let me first
tell you about two small non-stock investments that I made long ago. Though
neither changed my net worth by much, they are instructive.</p>
<p>This tale begins in Nebraska. From 1973 to 1981, the Midwest experienced an
explosion in farm prices, caused by a widespread belief that runaway
inflation was coming and fueled by the lending policies of small rural banks.
Then the bubble burst, bringing price declines of 50% or more that devastated
both leveraged farmers and their lenders. Five times as many Iowa and
Nebraska banks failed in that bubble&rsquo;s aftermath than in our recent Great
Recession.</p>
<p>In 1986, I purchased a 400-acre farm, located 50 miles north of Omaha, from
the FDIC. It cost me $280,000, considerably less than what a failed bank had
lent against the farm a few years earlier. I knew nothing about operating a
farm. But I have a son who loves farming and I learned from him both how many
bushels of corn and soybeans the farm would produce and what the operating
expenses would be. From these estimates, I calculated the normalized return
from the farm to then be about 10%. I also thought it was likely that
productivity would improve over time and that crop prices would move higher
as well. Both expectations proved out.  I needed no unusual knowledge or
intelligence to conclude that the investment had no downside and potentially
had substantial upside. There would, of course, be the occasional bad crop
and prices would sometimes disappoint. But so what? There would be some
unusually good years as well, and I would never be under any pressure to sell
the property. Now, 28 years later, the farm has tripled its earnings and is
worth five times or more what I paid. I still know nothing about farming and
recently made just my second visit to the farm.</p>
<p>In 1993, I made another small investment. Larry Silverstein, Salomon&rsquo;s
landlord when I was the company&rsquo;s CEO, told me about a New York retail
property adjacent to NYU that the Resolution Trust Corp. was selling. Again,
a bubble had popped &ndash; this one involving commercial real estate &ndash; and the
RTC had been created to dispose of the assets of failed savings institutions
whose optimistic lending practices had fueled the folly.  Here, too, the
analysis was simple. As had been the case with the farm, the unleveraged
current yield from the property was about 10%. But the property had been
undermanaged by the RTC, and its income would increase when several vacant
stores were leased. Even more important, the largest tenant&rsquo;s who occupied
around 20% of the project&rsquo;s space &ndash; was paying rent of about $5 per foot,
whereas other tenants averaged $70. The expiration of this bargain lease in
nine years was certain to provide a major boost to earnings. The property&rsquo;s
location was also superb: NYU wasn&rsquo;t going anywhere.</p>
<p>I joined a small group, including Larry and my friend Fred Rose, that
purchased the parcel. Fred was an experienced, high-grade real estate
investor who, with his family, would manage the property. And manage it they
did. As old leases expired, earnings tripled. Annual distributions now exceed
35% of our original equity investment. Moreover, our original mortgage was
refinanced in 1996 and again in 1999, moves that allowed several special
distributions totaling more than 150% of what we had invested. I&rsquo;ve yet to
view the property.  Income from both the farm and the NYU real estate will
probably increase in the decades to come. Though the gains won&rsquo;t be dramatic,
the two investments will be solid and satisfactory holdings for my lifetime
and, subsequently, for my children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>I tell these tales to illustrate certain fundamentals of investing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to be an expert in order to achieve satisfactory investment
returns. But if you aren&rsquo;t, you must recognize your limitations and follow a
course certain to work reasonably well. Keep things simple and don&rsquo;t swing
for the fences. When promised quick profits, respond with a quick &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on the future productivity of the asset you are considering. If you
don&rsquo;t feel comfortable making a rough estimate of the asset&rsquo;s future
earnings, just forget it and move on. No one has the ability to evaluate
every investment possibility. But omniscience isn&rsquo;t necessary; you only need
to understand the actions you undertake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you instead focus on the prospective price change of a contemplated
purchase, you are speculating.  There is nothing improper about that. I know,
however, that I am unable to speculate successfully, and I am skeptical of
those who claim sustained success at doing so. Half of all coin-flippers will
win their first toss; none of those winners has an expectation of profit if
he continues to play the game. And the fact that a given asset has
appreciated in the recent past is never a reason to buy it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With my two small investments, I thought only of what the properties would
produce and cared not at all about their daily valuations. Games are won by
players who focus on the playing field &ndash; not by those whose eyes are glued
to the scoreboard. If you can enjoy Saturdays and Sundays without looking at
stock prices, give it a try on weekdays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forming macro opinions or listening to the macro or market predictions of
others is a waste of time.  Indeed, it is dangerous because it may blur your
vision of the facts that are truly important. (When I hear TV commentators
glibly opine on what the market will do next, I am reminded of Mickey
Mantle&rsquo;s scathing comment: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how easy this game is until you
get into that broadcasting booth.&rdquo;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My two purchases were made in 1986 and 1993. What the economy, interest
rates, or the stock market might do in the years immediately following &ndash;
1987 and 1994 &ndash; was of no importance to me in making those investments. I
can&rsquo;t remember what the headlines or pundits were saying at the time.
Whatever the chatter, corn would keep growing in Nebraska and students would
flock to NYU.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is one major difference between my two small investments and an
investment in stocks. Stocks provide you minute-to-minute valuations for your
holdings whereas I have yet to see a quotation for either my farm or the New
York real estate.</p>
<p>It should be an enormous advantage for investors in stocks to have those
wildly fluctuating valuations placed on their holdings &ndash;  and for some
investors, it is. After all, if a moody fellow with a farm bordering my
property yelled out a price every day to me at which he would either buy my
farm or sell me his &ndash; and those prices varied widely over short periods of
time depending on his mental state &ndash; how in the world could I be other than
benefited by his erratic behavior? If his daily shout-out was ridiculously
low, and I had some spare cash, I would buy his farm. If the number he yelled
was absurdly high, I could either sell to him or just go on farming.  Owners
of stocks, however, too often let the capricious and often irrational
behavior of their fellow owners cause them to behave irrationally as well.
Because there is so much chatter about markets, the economy, interest rates,
price behavior of stocks, etc., some investors believe it is important to
listen to pundits &ndash; and, worse yet, important to consider acting upon their
comments.</p>
<p>Those people who can sit quietly for decades when they own a farm or
apartment house too often become frenetic when they are exposed to a stream
of stock quotations and accompanying commentators delivering an implied
message of &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just sit there, do something.&rdquo; For these investors,
liquidity is transformed from the unqualified benefit it should be to a
curse.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;flash crash&rdquo; or some other extreme market fluctuation can&rsquo;t hurt an
investor any more than an erratic and mouthy neighbor can hurt my farm
investment. Indeed, tumbling markets can be helpful to the true investor if
he has cash available when prices get far out of line with values. A climate
of fear is your friend when investing; a euphoric world is your enemy.</p>
<p>During the extraordinary financial panic that occurred late in 2008, I never
gave a thought to selling my farm or New York real estate, even though a
severe recession was clearly brewing. And, if I had owned 100% of a solid
business with good long-term prospects, it would have been foolish for me to
even consider dumping it. So why would I have sold my stocks that were small
participations in wonderful businesses? True, any one of them might
eventually disappoint, but as a group they were certain to do well. Could
anyone really believe the earth was going to swallow up the incredible
productive assets and unlimited human ingenuity existing in America?</p></blockquote>
