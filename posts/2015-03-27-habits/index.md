# Habits


Truly great things require consistent, long term effort inspired by purpose and
driven by progress[^1]. It is even more of an uphill task when micro progress may
be incremental and hard to measure -- how much weight have you lost since that
last gym session, or perhaps how much better of an artist are you after that
last painting, or even how much better is that savings account because of that
coffee you made yourself this morning?

Moving averages and running counters never lie. Enough gym sessions and healthy
eating lead to significant weight loss. A painting a day for a year made Paris
take notice of Van Gogh's refined impressionism. A coffee made each morning
saves over a thousand dollars a year (and many hours waiting in line).

The decision branch at the start is often the hardest part. I've found
consistently beginning with the smallest and most unrelated of details is
enough to get the routine going. It could be the the warm coffee in my hand
before I sit down for the next few hours, or perhaps putting away my cellphone
at the start of a mindfulness session, or the mere the change of footwear
before I head to the gym.

To create a habit is to soften the blow of the decision making process by
repeatedly biasing it.
