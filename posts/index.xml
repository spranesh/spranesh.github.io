    <description><![CDATA[<p>Berkshire Hathaway held it&rsquo;s first virtual AGM this weekend, thanks to the
ongoing pandemic. Buffett first spoke for an hour about some history of the
market, followed by the formal shareholder&rsquo;s meeting, and roughly 2 hours of
Q&amp;A to top it off. His presentation was a masterclass in market history, time
travel and public speaking. All questions this year had to be routed through
the journalist panel of Becky Quick, Carol Loomis and Andrew Ross Sorkin. The
resulting questions were of really high quality. I quite liked this
virtual-only format. Here are my high level takeaways from the event.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>After nearly a decade, the much awaited bear market is on us. It didn&rsquo;t arrive
in any form or shape that anyone would have liked or predicted, but that&rsquo;s how
regimes change in the equity markets. I plan to write up my thoughts soon, but
in the meantime, I wanted to share this excellent podcast interview of JL
Collins on the Mad Fientist.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">You and Your
Research</a>&rdquo; is one
of my favorite lectures on the scientific process. In it, Turing Award winner,
Richard Hamming, speaks about the importance of selecting the right problem.
This key idea turns out to be of massive significance in the investing process as well.</p>

    <title>The selfless legend: John Bogle</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, we are aware that something is very likely to happen, but we don&rsquo;t
fully digest the implications until we go through the motions. For many years
now, John C. Bogle, the founder of Vanguard group has signalled about his
declining health. Earlier today, news arrived that he <a href="http://www.philly.com/business/john-bogle-dead-vanguard-obituary-20190116.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">passed
away</a>.</p>
<p>John Bogle was a selfless legend of the investment world. By creating one of
the first index funds at very low fees, he provided the world with an elegant
way to get market returns. Incidentally, this arose out of his undergraduate
thesis at Princeton, where he studied the performance of mutual funds and
concluded that the vast majority of them underperform the market.</p>]]></description>

    <title>An estimate of the size of passive indexing</title>
    <link>http://pranesh.srinivasan.blog/posts/2018-06-20-passive-indexing/</link>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>With low fees, excellent diversification, and probabilities in the investor&rsquo;s
favor, indexing and passive investing have been on the rise for the last 40
years. <a href="http://www.vanguard.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Vanguard</a> is a leader in this field, offering
investors access to the world&rsquo;s stocks for less than a tenth of a percent.</p>
<p>A common question that repeatedly arises is &ldquo;What if everybody indexes?&rdquo;.
While I don&rsquo;t think this is an issue (since prices are set at the margin and
more that 95% of trading on the exchanges is the result of active flows) this
question is not without merit. To even begin answering this question, it is
important to understand the current size of passive indexing. This is not as
obvious as it may initially seem.  FT reports that passive investing is a
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4cdf2f88-7695-11e6-b60a-de4532d5ea35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">third of the
market</a>,
another source says it&rsquo;s
<a href="https://mathinvestor.org/2018/03/does-indexing-threaten-the-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">24%</a>,
while another estimate says it&rsquo;s less than
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-funds-blackrock-passive/less-than-18-percent-of-global-stocks-owned-by-index-investors-blackrock-idUSKCN1C82TE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">10%</a>.
So, which is it?</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago, I wrote about <a href="/2017/09/14/fairfax-financial-holdings/" rel="">Fairfax Financial
Holdings</a>. Fairfax India Holdings(FIH)
is a partly-owned subsidiary of Fairfax Financial Holdings that primarily
invests in India. FIH IPOed in 2014 at $10 per share. After a rise of nearly
70%, recent pullbacks put FIH back at around book value.</p>

    <title>Value investing during the last bull cycle</title>
    <link>http://pranesh.srinivasan.blog/posts/2017-11-26-value-in-the-cycle/</link>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, there have been many pieces that claim that value investing has not
worked this cycle. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/24/david-einhorn-value-investing-may-be-dead-and-amazon-and-tesla-killed-it.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Einhorn</a> questioned if value investing is dead and
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-08/goldman-sachs-mulls-death-of-value-investing-after-losing-decade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Goldman Sachs</a> mulled it.</p>
<p>Others have suggested that value works, but it has evolved. The claim is that
quantitative measures no longer work (certainly not P/B, at least) and
identifying value is about qualitative analysis. For example, growing companies
with wide moats and ability to reinvest capital are regularly mispriced. All of
this appeals to intuition. Several value managers have underperformed and some
others have closed shop. But is it true?</p>]]></description>

    <title>Fairfax Financial Holdings</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Fairfax financial holdings was formed when Prem Watsa and a motley crew of four
others took over Markel Financial Canda in 1985. Since then, Fairfax has
compounded it&rsquo;s book at nearly 20% per year. A $10,000 investment in 1985 would
be worth nearly $2 million today.</p>
<p>Many consider Fairfax to be the Berkshire Hathaway of Canada. However, the last
few years have not been easy for the company due to increased caution exercised
by the management. After some changes to the investment portfolio last year,
and unlocking hidden value in the last two quarters, the future looks
promising.</p>]]></description>
