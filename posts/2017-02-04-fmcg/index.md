# Survey of non-food FMCGs


Fast moving consumer goods (FMCGs) are an essential part of our lives today.
Not all FMCGs are commodities however. Some brands continue to engage a loyal
and growing user base due to superior products, global outreach, and decades of
advertising. Colgate is synonymous for the entire dental care industry, as Gillette is for
men's hygiene.

A billion people are being added to the middle class over the next decade.
Purchasing power continues to grow and demographics continue to be favourable.
We have more single person households than ever before. At the same time, there
is disruption happening at an unprecedented scale. Whether it's better online
distribution like the [Dollar Shave Club](http://www.dollarshaveclub.com) or a
growing number of white label products, moats that were considered unbreachable
have started to chip away.

I surveyed Colgate, P&G, and Unilever in mid January. It involved reading
dozens of 10-Ks, and close to two weeks of work. At the end, I was rewarded
with an increased clarity in thinking about this space. There are only two
major factors that matter over a decade -- organic sales growth, and capital
allocation. The rest, as they say, is noise.
