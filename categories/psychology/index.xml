    <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently read, &ldquo;The Professional&rdquo; by Subroto Bagchi
(<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Subroto-Bagchi/dp/0670082953" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">amazon</a>),
when I came across a wonderful chapter on the value of the human touch. In it,
Bagchi says that most modern professionals have forgotten the value of the
human touch. He makes an extremely good case citing how most people are driven
by the need to belong and appreciated more than anything else.</p>
<p>The highlight of the chapter for me was a section on Dr. Devi Shetty. Dr. Devi
Shetty runs Narayana Hrudalaya (now called Narayana Health), a heart hospital
in India. Headquartered in Bengaluru, the chain operates a chain of hospitals,
heart centers, primary care facilities across India. It also has one of the
largest telemedicine networks in the world.</p>]]></description>

    <title>The busyness of work</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Consider renting a house in a competitive and busy area. Imagine someone who
drives around many neighbourhoods looking for &ldquo;To Let&rdquo; signs. On finding one,
he notes down the contact number, revisits it during business hours after
scheduling an appointment, only to find that the house has a carpeted floor
which does not suit his allergies. He repeats the process over a few weeks
until he finds one suitable to his tastes and budget.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Truly great things require consistent, long term effort inspired by purpose and
driven by progress<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It is even more of an uphill task when micro progress may
be incremental and hard to measure &ndash; how much weight have you lost since that
last gym session, or perhaps how much better of an artist are you after that
last painting, or even how much better is that savings account because of that
coffee you made yourself this morning?</p>]]></description>

    <title>The decision-outcome matrix</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Consider any decision that can either be <em>taken</em> or <em>not taken</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and the outcome of this decision
to either be <em>good</em> or <em>bad</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
  <colgroup>
    <col class="col-md-4"><col class="col-md-4"><col class="col-md-4">
  </colgroup>
  <thead>
    <tr><td></td> <th><center>Good Outcome</center></th><th><center>Bad Outcome</center></th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td> Decision Taken     </td> <td><center>1</center></td><td><center>2</center></td></tr>
    <tr><td> Decision Not Taken </td> <td><center>3</center></td><td><center>4</center></td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>1</strong> and <strong>4</strong> are the easy cases - much good was had, and much sadness was avoided.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> leads to a feeling of disappointment, with much time spent on focusing on
the outcome. <strong>3</strong> leads to regret, with much time spent on focusing on the
personal choices and a desire to have done something differently. These two
feelings are not the same<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and while the relative magnitude of these feelings
is of course a function of personal outlook, studies<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> do show that dealing
with regret is harder<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>]]></description>
