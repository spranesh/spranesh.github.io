    <description><![CDATA[<p>Consider renting a house in a competitive and busy area. Imagine someone who
drives around many neighbourhoods looking for &ldquo;To Let&rdquo; signs. On finding one,

which does not suit his allergies. He repeats the process over a few weeks
until he finds one suitable to his tastes and budget.</p>]]></description>
